# GfG 160: Master DSA in 160 Days 🚀

Welcome to my private repository for the **GfG 160 Program**! This repository is dedicated to solving the handpicked DSA problems provided in the program and organizing the solutions topic-wise for better learning and reference.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
The repository is divided into folders corresponding to the 19 modules covered in the program:

GfG_160/ │ ├── Arrays/ # Problems for Days 1–13 ├── Strings/ # Problems for Days 14–20 ├── Sorting/ # Problems for Days 21–27 ├── Searching/ # Problems for Days 28–35 ├── Matrix/ # Problems for Days 36–41 ├── Hashing/ # Problems for Days 42–49 ├── Two_Pointer_Technique/ # Problems for Days 50–61 ├── Prefix_Sum/ # Problems for Days 62–66 ├── Linked_List/ # Problems for Days 67–76 ├── Backtracking/ # Problems for Days 77–79 ├── Trees/ # Problems for Days 80–92 ├── Heap/ # Problems for Days 93–96 ├── Stack/ # Problems for Days 97–105 ├── Queue_and_Deque/ # Problems for Days 106–107 ├── Dynamic_Programming/ # Problems for Days 108–133 ├── Greedy/ # Problems for Days 134–137 ├── Graphs/ # Problems for Days 138–152 ├── Tries/ # Problems for Days 153–155 └── Bit_Manipulation/ # Problems for Days 156–160

Each folder contains:
- **Problem Statements**: Detailed descriptions of the problems.
- **Solutions**: My code implementations for each problem.
- **Notes**: Key concepts, approaches, and observations related to the topic.
